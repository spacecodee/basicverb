CMake Warning (dev) at /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/x64/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/FetchContent.cmake:1953 (message):
  Calling FetchContent_Populate(juce) is deprecated, call
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(juce) instead.  Policy CMP0169 can be set to OLD
  to allow FetchContent_Populate(juce) to be called directly for now, but the
  ability to call it with declared details will be removed completely in a
  future version.
